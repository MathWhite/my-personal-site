# Hello, I'm Matheus Carvalho!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a **Senior Analyst and Developer, specializing in system integration**, with a passion for learning new things and evolving. Here, I share a bit of my work, ideas, and learnings from my journey.

Whether to share knowledge, showcase projects, or simply exchange experiences, I hope you find something that inspires or adds value to your visit.

> This site was built with **Docsify**, a fast, lightweight, and minimalist tool I frequently use to create documentation. However, it's quite simple. As you'll see in the [projects](projetos.md) section, I'm studying other approaches to create a **V2** with more features.

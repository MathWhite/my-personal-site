## My Journey

Since I was young, I've always been fascinated by creation and mathematics. Initially, this led me to pursue a degree in engineering, focusing on Civil Engineering. However, over time—influenced by a technical course I took—I developed a growing interest in electronics. Additionally, I've always been passionate about games. The combination of electronics, mathematics, and games led me to my current degree in Digital Games, where I learned to program and create using computers.

During my studies, I joined a technology company (Wevo Tecnologia) as an intern. Over time, I grew within the company, where I continue to work today.

## What Do I Do?

Professionally, I am a **Technical Lead** in the Professional Services area. In this role, I take on projects where I perform complex integrations using the Jitterbit platform, delegate tasks, and ensure the quality of deliveries made by me and my team during two-week sprints.

Personally, I enjoy gaming, watching movies and series, and studying. I'm always looking for something new to invent and create. The more I study, the more I realize how much I don't know. The vastness of things I want to specialize in keeps me eager to keep evolving.
